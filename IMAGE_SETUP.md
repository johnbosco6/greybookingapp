## Missing Images

### Option 1: Use Placeholder Generator (Quick)
1. Open `generate-placeholders.html` in your browser
2. It will automatically download placeholder images with nice gradients
3. Move the downloaded images to the appropriate folders:
   - Destinations → `public/images/destinations/`
   - Experiences → `public/images/experiences/`

### Option 2: Use Free Stock Photos (Recommended)
Download images from free stock photo sites like:
- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com)
- **Pexels** (pexels.com)
- **Pixabay** (pixabay.com)

#### Destinations Needed:
- `mazury.jpg` - Search: "Mazury lakes Poland"
- `bieszczady.jpg` - Search: "Bieszczady mountains Poland"
- `sopot.jpg` - Search: "Sopot pier Poland"
- `lublin.jpg` - Search: "Lublin old town Poland"

#### Experiences Needed:

### Option 3: Use Existing Hotel Images
The app already has hotel images in `public/images/design-mode/`. You can temporarily use these until you get proper destination/experience images.

## Current Status
- ✅ 6 destination images generated and added
- ⏳ 4 destination images needed

The app will work fine with placeholder images or you can add real photos later!
